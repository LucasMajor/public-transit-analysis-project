# Minnesota Public Transit Analysis

Public transportation is important in the foundation to creating more affordable, healthy, and livable cities. A transit score is a measure of how accessible public transit is for a given place. Currently, websites such as Zillow and Redfin assign these transit scores to properties in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. However, they do not have scores available for properties in surrounding cities, even though many of these cities have transit access. As a result, the goal of this project is to create a model that can assess the transit accessibility of all parcels within the Met Council 7 county region and assign a score to each parcel. The scores will be assigned based on the following attributes: the propertyâ€™s distance from transit stops, the number of transit stops within a distance, the frequency of the transit, and the type of transit (bus/light rail). From these attributes, both a weighted linear combination and a linear regression model will be implemented to model the scores.
